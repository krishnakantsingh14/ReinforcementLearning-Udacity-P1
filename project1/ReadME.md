# Unity Banana Navigation


## Project details

Project created as 1st project on Udacity Deep Reinforcement Learning nanodegree. The goal of the agent is to gather `yellow` bananas while avoiding the `blue` ones. Here are Unity details of the environment:

```
Unity brain name: BananaBrain
        Number of Visual Observations (per agent): 0
        Vector Observation space type: continuous
        Vector Observation space size (per agent): 37
        Number of stacked Vector Observation: 1
        Vector Action space type: discrete
        Vector Action space size (per agent): 4
        Vector Action descriptions: , , , 
```

That means we work with state vector containing 37 continous values and 4 discrete actions representing moves (forward, backward, turn left, turn right). The environment is considered solved when agents reaches average score of 13.0 on 100 consecutive episodes.

The task is episodic, and in order to solve the environment, your agent must get an average score of +13 over 100 consecutive episodes.

### Getting Started

1. Download the environment from one of the links below.  You need only select the environment that matches your operating system:
    - Linux: [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Linux.zip)
    - Mac OSX: [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana.app.zip)
    - Windows (32-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Windows_x86.zip)
    - Windows (64-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Windows_x86_64.zip)
    
    (_For Windows users_) Check out [this link](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/827218/how-to-determine-whether-a-computer-is-running-a-32-bit-version-or-64) if you need help with determining if your computer is running a 32-bit version or 64-bit version of the Windows operating system.

    (_For AWS_) If you'd like to train the agent on AWS (and have not [enabled a virtual screen](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Training-on-Amazon-Web-Service.md)), then please use [this link](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Linux_NoVis.zip) to obtain the environment.

2. Then you should be able to run `jupyter notebook` and view `Navigation.ipynb`.
File `ddqn_agent.py` contains agents and neural network class that has been used to approximate Q values using dueling DQN algorithm.

## Instructions

Run `Navigation.ipynb` for further details.


## Solution

Agent is able to average score of 13 in 487 episodes.
