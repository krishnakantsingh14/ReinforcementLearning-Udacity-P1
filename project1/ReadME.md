# Unity Banana Navigation


## Project details

Project created as 1st project on Udacity Deep Reinforcement Learning nanodegree. The goal of the agent is to gather `yellow` bananas while avoiding the `blue` ones. Here are Unity details of the environment:

```
Unity brain name: BananaBrain
        Number of Visual Observations (per agent): 0
        Vector Observation space type: continuous
        Vector Observation space size (per agent): 37
        Number of stacked Vector Observation: 1
        Vector Action space type: discrete
        Vector Action space size (per agent): 4
        Vector Action descriptions: , , , 
```

That means we work with state vector containing 37 continous values and 4 discrete actions representing moves (forward, backward, turn left, turn right). The environment is considered solved when agents reaches average score of 13.0 on 100 consecutive episodes.

#### Challenge 

The task is episodic, and in order to solve the environment, your agent must get an average score of +13 over 100 consecutive episodes.

### Getting Started

1. Download the environment from one of the links below.  You need only select the environment that matches your operating system:
    - Linux: [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Linux.zip)
    - Mac OSX: [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana.app.zip)
    - Windows (32-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Windows_x86.zip)
    - Windows (64-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Windows_x86_64.zip)
    
    (_For Windows users_) Check out [this link](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/827218/how-to-determine-whether-a-computer-is-running-a-32-bit-version-or-64) if you need help with determining if your computer is running a 32-bit version or 64-bit version of the Windows operating system.

    (_For AWS_) If you'd like to train the agent on AWS (and have not [enabled a virtual screen](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Training-on-Amazon-Web-Service.md)), then please use [this link](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Linux_NoVis.zip) to obtain the environment.

2. Then you should be able to run `jupyter notebook` and view `Navigation.ipynb`.
File `ddqn_agent.py` contains agents and neural network class that has been used to approximate Q values using dueling DQN algorithm.

## Instructions

Run `Navigation.ipynb` for further details.


## Solution

Agent is able to average score of 13 in 487 episodes.
